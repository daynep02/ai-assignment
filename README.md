Using AI for this homework allows for a very quick creation of boilerplate code that requires very little tweaking to get where I want it to
be. The advantage is I do not have to think very hard about how to create this code becuase the AI does it all for me. If I ask it
to do something it will try its hardest to do it.

The dangers with using AI to generate this notebook without learning data-science properly is that the person creating it will have no
idea what it means. The biggest example is the never-fraud model, which has really high accuracy, but if you look at other metrics they 
all are very very low in comparison. This is because there is such a low amount of fraud in the dataset that it seems to be okay
to just guess that a transaction is not fraud. The instances I had to verify for correctness were the ones where I was creating
the plot showing the scores of the metrics compared to one another. I knew I had to verify those because the plots were completely wrong,
mostly because the AI tried to make the plots the wrong way, grouping by model instead of by metric.
